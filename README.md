AIRPORT
=======


As the Week 3 challenge at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) we
were tasked with creating a model for an airport usig TDD. This is what I did.

####How to use

The model is not hooked up to an interface, so you won't be able to use
it. Unless you write one.

####Testing

The model is tested using [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec). Once the
repository is cloned, run `bundle` to install the dependencies and `rspec` to
run the test suite.
